# What is generative AI? 
Generative AI, sometimes called gen AI, is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create original content such 
as text, images, video, audio or software code in response to a user’s prompt or request. 
Generative AI relies on sophisticated machine learning models called deep learning models algorithms 
that simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain. These models work by 
identifying and encoding the patterns and relationships in huge amounts of data, and then using that 
information to understand users' natural language requests or questions and respond with relevant new 
content. 
AI has been a hot technology topic for the past decade, but generative AI, and specifically the arrival of 
ChatGPT in 2022, has thrust AI into worldwide headlines and launched an unprecedented surge of AI 
innovation and adoption. Generative AI offers enormous productivity benefits for individuals and 
organizations, and while it also presents very real challenges and risks, businesses are forging ahead, 
exploring how the technology can improve their internal workflows and enrich their products and 
services. According to research by the management consulting firm McKinsey, one third of organizations 
are already using generative AI regularly in at least one business function.¹ Industry analyst Gartner 
projects more than 80% of organizations will have deployed generative AI applications or used 
generative AI application programming interfaces (APIs) by 2026.2 
# How generative AI works: 
For the most part, generative AI operates in three phases:  
Training, to create a foundation model that can serve as the basis of multiple gen AI applications. 
Tuning, to tailor the foundation model to a specific gen AI application. 
Generation, evaluation and retuning, to assess the gen AI application's output and continually improve 
its quality and accuracy. 
Training 
Generative AI begins with a foundation model, a deep learning model that serves as the basis for 
multiple different types of generative AI applications. The most common foundation models today are 
large language models (LLMs), created for text generation applications, but there are also foundation 
models for image generation, video generation, and sound and music generation as well as multimodal 
foundation models that can support several kinds content generation. 
To create a foundation model, practitioners train a deep learning algorithm on huge volumes of raw, 
unstructured, unlabeled data e.g., terabytes of data culled from the internet or some other huge data 
source. During training, the algorithm performs and evaluates millions of ‘fill in the blank’ exercises, 
trying to predict the next element in a sequence e.g., the next word in a sentence, the next element in an 
image, the next command in a line of code and continually adjusting itself to minimize the difference 
between its predictions and the actual data (or ‘correct’ result). 
The result of this training is a neural network of parameters, encoded representations of the entities, 
patterns and relationships in the data, that can generate content autonomously in response to inputs, or 
prompts. 
This training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive: it requires thousands of 
clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which costs millions of dollars. 
Open-source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this 
step and its costs. 
Tuning 
Metaphorically speaking, a foundation model is a generalist: It knows a lot about a lot of types of 
content, but often can’t generate specific types of output with desired accuracy or fidelity. For that, the 
model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This can be done in a variety of ways. 
Fine tuning 
Fine tuning involves feeding the model labeled data specific to the content generation application 
questions or prompts the application is likely to receive, and corresponding correct answers in the 
desired format. For example, if a development team is trying to create a customer service chatbot, it 
would create hundreds or thousands of documents containing labeled customers service questions and 
correct answers, and then feed those documents to the model. 
Fine-tuning is labor-intensive. Developers often outsource the task to companies with large data-labeling 
workforces. 
Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) 
In RLHF, human users respond to generated content with evaluations the model can use to update the 
model for greater accuracy or relevance. Often, RLHF involves people ‘scoring’ different outputs in 
response to the same prompt. But it can be as simple as having people type or talk back to a chatbot or 
virtual assistant, correcting its output. 
Generation, evaluation, more tuning 
Developers and users continually assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the 
model even as often as once a week for greater accuracy or relevance. (In contrast, the foundation 
model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months.) 
Another option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation (RAG). RAG 
is a framework for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data, 
to supplement and refine the parameters or representations in the original model. RAG can ensure that 
a generative AI app always has access to the most current information. As a bonus, the additional 
sources accessed via RAG are transparent to users in a way that the knowledge in the original foundation 
model is not. 
# Generative AI is poised to affect multiple roles within various sectors: 
Generative AI model architectures and how they have evolved 
Truly generative AI models deep learning models that can autonomously create content on demand have 
evolved over the last dozen years or so. The milestone model architectures during that period include 
Variational autoencoders (VAEs), which drove breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language 
processing and anomaly detection. 
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models, which improved the accuracy of previous 
applications and enabled some of the first AI solutions for photo-realistic image generation. 
Transformers, the deep learning model architecture behind the foremost foundation models and 
generative AI solutions today. 
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) 
An autoencoder is a deep learning model comprising two connected neural networks: One that encodes 
(or compresses) a huge amount of unstructured, unlabeled training data into parameters, and another 
that decodes those parameters to reconstruct the content. Technically, autoencoders can generate new 
content, but they’re more useful for compressing data for storage or transfer, and decompressing it for 
use, than they are for high-quality content generation. 
Introduced in 2013, variational autoencoders (VAEs) can encode data like an autoencoder, but decode 
multiple new variations of the content. By training a VAE to generate variations toward a particular goal, 
it can ‘zero in’ on more accurate, higher-fidelity content over time. Early VAE applications included 
anomaly detection (e.g., medical image analysis) and natural language generation. 
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 
GANs, introduced in 2014, also comprise two neural networks: A generator, which generates new 
content, and a discriminator, which evaluates the accuracy and quality the generated data. These 
adversarial algorithms encourages the model to generate increasingly high-quality outpits. 
GANs are commonly used for image and video generation, but can generate high-quality, realistic 
content across various domains. They've proven particularly successful at tasks as style transfer (altering 
the style of an image from, say, a photo to a pencil sketch) and data augmentation (creating new, 
synthetic data to increase the size and diversity of a training data set). 
Diffusion models 
Also introduced in 2014, diffusion models work by first adding noise to the training data until it’s random 
and unrecognizable, and then training the algorithm to iteratively diffuse the noise to reveal a desired 
output. 

![Screenshot 2025-04-25 091021](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/274efc3c-252f-4b56-a773-ec8f9202cf24)

Diffusion models take more time to train than VAEs or GANs, but ultimately offer finer-grained control 
over output, particularly for high-quality image generation tool. DALL-E, Open AI’s image-generation 
tool, is driven by a diffusion model. 
Transformers 
First documented in a 2017 paper published by Ashish Vaswani and others, transformers evolve the 
encoder-decoder paradigm to enable a big step forward in the way foundation models are trained, and 
in the quality and range of content they can produce. These models are at the core of most of today’s 
headline-making generative AI tools, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, Copilot, BERT, Bard, and Midjourney 
to name a few. 
Transformers use a concept called attention, determining and focusing on what’s most important about 
data within a sequence to; 
process entire sequences of data e.g., sentences instead of individual words simultaneously; 
capture the context of the data within the sequence; 
encode the training data into embeddings (also called hyperparameters) that represent the data and its 
context. 
In addition to enabling faster training, transformers excel at natural language processing (NLP) and 
natural language understanding (NLU), and can generate longer sequences of data e.g., not just answers 
to questions, but poems, articles or papers with greater accuracy and higher quality than other deep 
generative AI models. Transformer models can also be trained or tuned to use tools e.g., a spreadsheet 
application, HTML, a drawing program to output content in a particular format. 
# What generative AI can create: 
Generative AI can create many types of content across many different domains.  
Text- 
Generative models. especially those based on transformers, can generate coherent, contextually 
relevant text, everything from instructions and documentation to brochures, emails, web site copy, 
blogs, articles, reports, papers, and even creative writing. They can also perform repetitive or tedious 
writing tasks (e.g., such as drafting summaries of documents or meta descriptions of web pages), freeing 
writers’ time for more creative, higher-value work. 
Images and video- 
Image generation such as DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can create realistic images or original 
art, and can perform style transfer, image-to-image translation and other image editing or image 
enhancement tasks. Emerging gen AI video tools can create animations from text prompts, and can apply 
special effects to existing video more quickly and cost-effectively than other methods. 
Sound, speech and music- 
Generative models can synthesize natural-sounding speech and audio content for voice-enabled AI 
chatbots and digital assistants, audiobook narration and other applications. The same technology can 
generate original music that mimics the structure and sound of professional compositions. 
Software code- 
Gen AI can generate original code, autocomplete code snippets, translate between programming 
languages and summarize code functionality. It enables developers to quickly prototype, refactor, and 
debug applications while offering a natural language interface for coding tasks. 
Design and art- 
Generative AI models can generate unique works of art and design, or assist in graphic design. 
Applications include dynamic generation of environments, characters or avatars, and special effects for 
virtual simulations and video games. 
Simulations and synthetic data- 
Generative AI models can be trained to generate synthetic data, or synthetic structures based on real or 
synthetic data. For example, generative AI is applied in drug discovery to generate molecular structures 
with desired properties, aiding in the design of new pharmaceutical compounds.

# Benefits of generative AI 
The obvious, overarching benefit of generative AI is greater efficiency. Because it can generate content 
and answers on demand, gen AI has the potential to accelerate or automate labor-intensive tasks, cut 
costs, and free employees time for higher-value work. 
But generative AI offers several other benefits for indivuduals and organizations. 
Enhanced creativity 
Gen AI tools can inspire creativity through automated brainstorming, generating multiple novel versions 
of content. These variations can also serve as starting points or references that help writers, artists, 
designers and other creators plow through creative blocks. 
Improved (and faster) decision-making 
Generative AI excels at analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns and extracting meaningful insights, 
then generating hypotheses and recommendations based on those insights to support executives, 
analysts, researchers and other professionals in making smarter, data-driven decisions. 
Dynamic personalization 
In applications like recommendation systems and content creation, generative AI can analyze user 
preferences and history and generate personalized content in real time, leading to a more tailored and 
engaging user experience. 
Constant availability 
Generative AI operates continuously without fatigue, providing around-the-clock availability for tasks like 
customer support chatbots and automated responses. 
Use cases for generative AI: 
The following are just a handful of gen AI use cases for enterprises. As the technology develops and 
organizations embed these tools into their workflows, we can expect to see many more.  
Customer experience 
Marketing organizations can save time and amp up their content production by using gen AI tools to 
draft copy for blogs, web pages, collateral, emails and more. But generative AI solutions can also produce 
highly personalized marketing copy and visuals in real time based on when, where and to whom the ad is 
delivered. And it will power next-generation chatbots and virtual agents that can give personalized 
responses and even initiate actions on behalf of customer, a significant advancement compared to the 
previous generation of conversational AI models trained on more limited data for very specific tasks. 
Software development and application modernization 
Code generation tools can automate and accelerate the process of writing new code. Code generation 
also has the potential to dramatically accelerate application modernization by automating much of the 
repetitive coding required to modernize legacy applications for hybrid cloud environments. 
Digital labor 
Generative AI can quickly draw up or revise contracts, invoices, bills and other digital or physical 
‘paperwork’ so that employees who use or manage it can focus on higher level tasks. This can accelerate 
workflows in virtually every enterprise area including human resources, legal, procurement and finance. 
Science, engineering and research 
Generative AI models can help scientists and engineers propose novel solutions to complex problems. In 
healthcare, for example, generative models can be applied to synthesize medical images for training and 
testing medical imaging systems.

# Challenges, limitations and risks 
Generative AI has made remarkable strides in a relatively short period of time, but still presents 
significant challenges and risks to developers, users and the public at large. Below are some of the most 
serious issues, and how they're being addressed.  
‘Hallucinations’ and other inaccurate outputs 
An AI hallucination is a generative AI output that is nonsensical or altogether inaccurate but, all too 
often, seems entirely plausible. The classic example is when a lawyer used a gen AI tool for research in 
preparation for a high-profile case and the tool ‘produced’ several example cases, complete with quotes 
and attributions, that were entirely fictional. 
Some practitioners view hallucinations as an unavoidable consequence of balancing a model’s accuracy 
and its creative capabilities. But developers may implement preventative measures, called guardrails, 
that restrict the model to relevant or trusted data sources. Continual evaluation and tuning can also help 
reduce hallucinations and inaccuracies. 
# Inconsistent outputs 
Due to the variational or probabilistic nature of gen AI models, the same inputs can result in slightly or 
significantly different outputs. This can be undesirable in certain applications, such as customer service 
chatbots, where consistent outputs are expected or desired. Through prompt engineering iteratively 
refining or compounding prompts, users can arrive at prompts that consistently deliver the results they 
want from their generative AI applications. 
# Bias 
Generative models may learn societal biases present in the training data or in the labeled data, external 
data sources, or human evaluators used to tune the model and generate biased, unfair or offensive 
content as a result. To prevent biased outputs from their models, developers must ensure diverse 
training data, establish guidelines for preventing bias during training and tuning, and continually evaluate 
model outputs for bias as well as accuracy. 
# Lack of explainability and metrics 
Many generative AI models are ‘black box’ models, meaning it can be challenging or impossible to 
understand their decision-making processes; even the engineers or data scientists who create the 
underlying algorithm can understand or explain what exactly is happening inside it and how it arrives at a 
specific result. Explainable AI practices and techniques can help practitioners and users understand and 
trust the processes and outputs of generative models. 
Assessing and comparing the quality of generated content can also be challenging. Traditional evaluation 
metrics may not capture the nuanced aspects of creativity, coherence, or relevance. Developing robust 
and reliable evaluation methods for generative AI remains an active area of research. 
Threats to security, privacy and intellectual property 
Generative AI models can be exploited to generate convincing phishing emails, fake identities or other 
malicious content that can fool users into taking actions that compromise security and data privacy. 
Developers and users need to be careful that data put into the model (during tuning, or as part of a 
prompt) doesn’t expose their own intellectual property (IP) or any information protected as IP by other 
organizations. And they need to monitor outputs for new content that exposes their own IP or violates 
others' IP protections. 
Deepfakes 
Deepfakes are AI-generated or AI-manipulated images, video or audio created to convince people that 
they’re seeing, watching or hearing someone do or say something they never did or said. They are 
among the most chilling examples of how the power of generative AI can be applied with malicious 
intent. 

![Screenshot 2025-04-25 085706](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d5d95e8-38f7-417e-a8e1-55b9c8c9456d)

Most people are familiar with deepfakes created to damage reputations or spread misinformation. More 
recently, cybercriminals have deployed deepfakes as part of cyberattacks (e.g., fake voices in voice 
phishing scams) or financial fraud schemes. 
# Conceptual framework of generative AI 
Table 1 Overview of core deep generative models 
Deep generative model                                                             
Description 
Generative adversarial network (GAN) 
Description   
Generative adversarial networks consist of two competing neural networks: a generator and a 
discriminator (Goodfellow et al., 2020). The generator creates realistic data samples, while the 
discriminator distinguishes between real and generated samples (Pan et al., 2019). Both neural networks 
are trained together until the discriminator is not able to diferentiate both samples (Janiesch et al., 
2021).This adversarial competition results in the generator improving its data generation capabilities 
over time, eventually producing high-quality, realistic outputs. Hence, GANs fnd various applications,for 
instance, in image generation and manipulation, object detection and segmentation, and natural 
language processing (Aggarwal et al., 2021; Gui et al., 2023) 
Deep generative model                                                              
Variational autoencoder (VAE) 
Description 
Variational autoencoders employ a neural network to learn encoding compressed input data into a 
lower-dimensional latent space and then decode the data by reconstructing the original data from the 
latent space representation (Kingma et al., 2014). By optimizing a variational lower bound on the data 
likelihood in a probabilistic approach, VAEs can generate new samples that resemble the original data 
distribution. Typical use cases for VAEs can be seen in the synthetic generation and reconstruction of 
data such as images, in anomaly detection, and recommendation systems (Wei & Mahmood, 2021) 
Deep generative model                                                              
Transformer

Description 
Transformer models have become the basis for many state-of-the-art natural language processing tasks 
and succeeding models. They are a specifc type of neural network architecture that employ selfattention 
mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in the data, making them well-suited for large-scale 
language modeling tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017) Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) build on the 
transformer architecture and were trained with large datasets of unlabeled data (Brown et al., 2020). 
Due to their large size (i.e., a very large number of trainable parameters), GPT trained on text data are 
often referred to as large language models (LLMs) (Schramowski et al., 2022). The goal of LLMs is to 
generate novel, coherent, contextually relevant human-like text by predicting which token is most likely 
to occur after the prior tokens in a sentence (Brown et al., 2020; H. Li, 2022). Hence, LLMs can serve as 
the foundation for conversational AI tools like ChatGPT (Teubner et al., 2023). Besides conversing, the 
large amount of information stored in LLMs can be used for text generation, writing, or even 
programming, e.g., to support scholars (Cooper, 2023; Lund et al., 2023) 
Latent difusion model (LDM) 
Description 
Latent difusion models are transformer based and build on the concepts of denoising score matching and 
contrastive divergence to learn a stochastic data generation process (Rombach et al., 2022). In LDMs, the 
generation process starts with a simple initial distribution, such as Gaussian noise. Then,the data gets 
gradually refned through a series of noise-reduction steps following a predefned diffusion process 
through a latent space (Ho et al., 2020). The key advantage of LDMs is their ability to learn complex data 
distributions without requiring adversarial training (as in GANs) or optimizing variational lower bounds 
(as in VAEs). They also feature improved stability over other DGMs during training to be less prone to 
issues like mode collapse (Kodali et al., 2017; Rombach et al.,2022), making them well-suited for 
high-quality and detailed outputs, such as high-resolution image synthesis (Ho et al., 2020) 
Procedural diferences of generative AI and discriminative AI 
Overview of diferent output modalities for generative AI applications 
# Modality--Text 
Description: 
X-to-text applications are centered around text generation and natural language processing. The goal is 
to generate human-like written text that fts the user’s input prompt by providing a meaningful answer 
within the context. For instance, chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT imitate textual conversations with the 
user and can be guided to output text artifacts as desired (OpenAI, 2023). Furthermore, text-producing 
applications can be leveraged for content creation (e.g., copywriting or specifc writing in e-commerce 
contexts) (Bakpayev et al., 2022; Brand et al., 2023). Moreover, text generation can support processes in 
sales or support by providing the ability to produce customized texts tailored toward the requests 
(Mondal et al., 2023). Systems integrating GAI models with further knowledge bases (e.g., enterprise 
data and Internet access) extend the available information beyond the model’s initial training dataset 
# Modality--Image 
Description: 
X-to-image applications generate images based on the user’s prompting. Relying on GANs or difusion 
models as DGMs, synthetic images are created that fnd use cases in marketing, design and fashion, or 
creative felds in the form of new visual art (Haaseet al., 2023; Mayahi & Vidrih, 2022; Zhang et al., 
2023a). For instance, Stable Difusion is an open-sourced x-to-image model that enables the generation of 
images in multiple GAI applications (Rombach et al., 2022). Moreover, generated synthetic images can 
act as training data for further ML models to train classifers (e.g., medical images to detect diseases (Ali 
et al., 2023)). Besides a text-to-image creation process, image editing capabilities are possible, e.g., via 
image-to-image systems that manipulate and extend images according to the user’s prompting 
(Oppenlaender, 2022) 
# Modality--Video 
Description: 
X-to-video applications deal with the creation of synthetic videos, i.e., dynamic motion images. New 
video clips are generated by describing the content of the desired video footage (text-to-video) or 
applying the style and composition via text or image prompt to a source video (video-to-video) (Esser et 
al., 2023). These prospects allow the fast and convenient creation and editing of videos via natural 
language and other modalities (Zhan et al., 2021). Thus, not only videographers beneft from x-to-video 
applications but also people without flming and editing skills are enabled to creatively express 
themselves due to an accessible creation process (Anantrasirichai & Bull, 2022). Besides recreational and 
entertainment purposes, x-to-video GAI models fnd application in sales and marketing (e.g., product 
marketing videos), onboarding and education (e.g., virtual avatars in training videos), or in customer 
support (e.g., how-to videos) (Leiker et al., 2023; Mayahi & Vidrih, 2022). As an exemplary application, 
Synthesia is a video creation platform specialized in generating professional videos with virtual avatars 
and synthetic voiceovers (Synthesia, 2023) 
# Modality--Code
Description: 
In the realm of software development, x-to-code GAI applications ofer transformative potential in how 
developers work and code by providing x-to-text capabilities specifc to programming languages. Models 
like CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) or GraphCodeBERT (Guo et al., 2021) were trained on programming 
code to generate source code from natural language or modeling languages for new software programs. 
Several x-to-text models also ofer coding capabilities because general-purpose LLMs are trained with 
increasingly large datasets that contain code (e.g., Stability.ai, 2023). Programmers using applications 
such as GitHub Copilot are supported by automatically written chunks of code, ideas converted into 
actionable scripts, auto-completion functions, generated unit tests, duplicate code detection, and bug 
fxing (Sun et al., 2022). These automation potentials allow developers to focus on higher-level tasks and 
problem solving, enhancing their productivity and the fnal product’s overall quality, reducing 
time-to-market, supporting rapid prototyping, and promoting continuous innovation for the product and 
business 
# Modality--Audio 
Description: 
X-to-audio applications focus on audio content generation and comprise, for instance, the generation of 
speech with synthetically generated human-like voices (Borsos et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Especially 
text-to-speech and speech-to-speech models are being heavily researched and can be used to power 
various applications, ranging from digital assistants and customer services to audiobook and training 
narration and accessibility tools (Moussawi et al., 2021; Qiu & Benbasat, 2005). GAI models like 
Microsoft’s VALL-E (Wang et al., 2023) ofer a more personalized and engaging user experience by 
enabling realistic voice modeling. Moreover, x-to-sound models fnd application in music creation. By 
specifying genres or melodies via prompts, unique pieces of music can be generated that respect the 
original intent (Agostinelli et al., 2023). GAI models such as MusicLM (Agostinelli et al.,2023) help 
musicians in their creative process, ofering inspiration and aiding the composition of complex pieces. 
Businesses in the music industry can leverage high-fdelity music generation to create customized 
soundtracks for marketing, movies, or video games,signifcantly reducing the cost and time associated 
with traditional music production (Anantrasirichai & Bull, 2022; Weng & Chen,2020) 
# Modality--Other 
Description: 
The applications of GAI extend beyond the stated modality types and domains, impacting multiple other, 
specifc areas. For instance,x-to-molecules models like AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021) and OpenBioML 
(Murphy & Thomas, 2023) generate viable protein structures and design new molecules by generating 
valid, novel molecular structures, supporting drug discovery and bioengineering researchers (Walters & 
Murcko, 2020). 3D modeling is also impacted by GAI applications such as DreamFusion (Poole et 
al.,2023), Nvidia GET3D (Gao et al., 2022), and Point-E (Nichol et al., 2022), which generate realistic and

# A brief history of generative AI: 
The term “generative AI” exploded into the public consciousness in the 2020s, but gen AI has been part 
of our lives for decades, and today’s generative AI technology draws on machine learning breakthroughs 
from as far back as the early 20th century. A non-exhaustive representative history of generative AI 
might include some of the following dates 
1964: MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum develops ELIZA, a text-based natural language 
processing application. Essentially the first chatbot (called a ‘chatterbot’ at the time), ELIZA used 
pattern-matching scripts to respond to typed natural language inputs with empathetic text responses. 
1999: Nvidia ships GeoForce, the first graphical processing unit. Originally developed to deliver smooth 
motion graphics for video games, GPUs had become the defacto platform for developing AI models and 
mining cryptocurrencies. 
2004: Google autocomplete first appears, generating potential next words or phrases as users enter their 
search terms. The relatively modern example of generative AI is based on a Markov Chain, a 
mathematical model developed in 1906. 
2013: The first variational autoencoders (VAEs) appear. 
2014: The first generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models appear. 
2017: Ashish Vaswani, a team at Google Brain, and a group from the University of Toronto publish 
“Attention is All You Need,” a paper documenting the principles of transformer models, widely 
acknowledged as enabling the most powerful foundation models and generative AI tools being 
developed today. 
2019-2020: OpenAI rolls out its GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) large language models, GPT-2 
and GPT-3. 
2022: OpenAI introduces ChatGPT, a front-end to GPT-3 that generates complex, coherent and 
contextual sentences and long-form content in response to end-user prompts.

# What are LLMs? 
Large language models (LLMs) are a category of foundation models trained on immense amounts of data 
making them capable of understanding and generating natural language and other types of content to 
perform a wide range of tasks. 
LLMs have become a household name thanks to the role they have played in bringing generative AI to 
the forefront of the public interest, as well as the point on which organizations are focusing to adopt 
artificial intelligence across numerous business functions and use cases. 
Outside of the enterprise context, it may seem like LLMs have arrived out of the blue along with new 
developments in generative AI. However, many companies, including IBM, have spent years 
implementing LLMs at different levels to enhance their natural language understanding (NLU) and 
natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. This has occurred alongside advances in machine learning, 
machine learning models, algorithms, neural networks and the transformer models that provide the 
architecture for these AI systems. 
LLMs are a class of foundation models, which are trained on enormous amounts of data to provide the 
foundational capabilities needed to drive multiple use cases and applications, as well as resolve a 
multitude of tasks. This is in stark contrast to the idea of building and training domain specific models for 
each of these use cases individually, which is prohibitive under many criteria (most importantly cost and 
infrastructure), stifles synergies and can even lead to inferior performance. 
LLMs represent a significant breakthrough in NLP and artificial intelligence, and are easily accessible to 
the public through interfaces like Open AI’s Chat GPT-3 and GPT-4, which have garnered the support of 
Microsoft. Other examples include Meta’s Llama models and Google’s bidirectional encoder 
representations from transformers (BERT/RoBERTa) and PaLM models. IBM has also recently launched 
its Granite model series on watsonx.ai, which has become the generative AI backbone for other IBM 
products like watsonx Assistant and watsonx Orchestrate.  
In a nutshell, LLMs are designed to understand and generate text like a human, in addition to other 
forms of content, based on the vast amount of data used to train them. They have the ability to infer 
from context, generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, translate to languages other than 
English, summarize text, answer questions (general conversation and FAQs) and even assist in creative 
writing or code generation tasks.  
They are able to do this thanks to billions of parameters that enable them to capture intricate patterns in 
language and perform a wide array of language-related tasks. LLMs are revolutionizing applications in 
various fields, from chatbots and virtual assistants to content generation, research assistance and 
language translation.

As they continue to evolve and improve, LLMs are poised to reshape the way we interact with 
technology and access information, making them a pivotal part of the modern digital landscape.

forwards it to the LLM either in simple language or encoded through Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD). 
Depending on the task, retrieval and generation may repeat multiple times. 
How large language models work: 
LLMs operate by leveraging deep learning techniques and vast amounts of textual data. These models 
are typically based on a transformer architecture, like the generative pre-trained transformer, which 
excels at handling sequential data like text input. LLMs consist of multiple layers of neural networks, 
each with parameters that can be fine-tuned during training, which are enhanced further by a numerous 
layer known as the attention mechanism, which dials in on specific parts of data sets. 
During the training process, these models learn to predict the next word in a sentence based on the 
context provided by the preceding words. The model does this through attributing a probability score to 
the recurrence of words that have been tokenized, broken down into smaller sequences of characters. 
These tokens are then transformed into embeddings, which are numeric representations of this context. 
To ensure accuracy, this process involves training the LLM on a massive corpora of text (in the billions of 
pages), allowing it to learn grammar, semantics and conceptual relationships through zero-shot and 
self-supervised learning. Once trained on this training data, LLMs can generate text by autonomously 
predicting the next word based on the input they receive, and drawing on the patterns and knowledge 
they've acquired. The result is coherent and contextually relevant language generation that can be 
harnessed for a wide range of NLU and content generation tasks. 
Model performance can also be increased through prompt engineering, prompt-tuning, fine-tuning and 
other tactics like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to remove the biases, hateful 
speech and factually incorrect answers known as “hallucinations” that are often unwanted byproducts of 
training on so much unstructured data. This is one of the most important aspects of ensuring 
enterprise-grade LLMs are ready for use and do not expose organizations to unwanted liability, or cause 
damage to their reputation.

# LLM use cases : 
LLMs are redefining an increasing number of business processes and have proven their versatility across 
a myriad of use cases and tasks in various industries. They augment conversational AI in chatbots and 
virtual assistants (like IBM watsonx Assistant and Google’s BARD) to enhance the interactions that 
underpin excellence in customer care, providing context-aware responses that mimic interactions with 
human agents. 
LLMs also excel in content generation, automating content creation for blog articles, marketing or sales 
materials and other writing tasks. In research and academia, they aid in summarizing and extracting 
information from vast datasets, accelerating knowledge discovery. LLMs also play a vital role in language 
translation, breaking down language barriers by providing accurate and contextually relevant 
translations. They can even be used to write code, or “translate” between programming languages. 
Moreover, they contribute to accessibility by assisting individuals with disabilities, including 
text-to-speech applications and generating content in accessible formats. From healthcare to finance, 
LLMs are transforming industries by streamlining processes, improving customer experiences and 
enabling more efficient and data-driven decision making. 
Most excitingly, all of these capabilities are easy to access, in some cases literally an API integration 
away. 
# LLM applications in different domains: 
Here is a list of some of the most important areas where LLMs benefit organizations: 
Text generation: language generation abilities, such as writing emails, blog posts or other mid-to-long 
form content in response to prompts that can be refined and polished. An excellent example is 
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
Content summarization: summarize long articles, news stories, research reports, corporate 
documentation and even customer history into thorough texts tailored in length to the output format. 
AI assistants: chatbots that answer customer queries, perform backend tasks and provide detailed 
information in natural language as a part of an integrated, self-serve customer care solution.  
Code generation: assists developers in building applications, finding errors in code and uncovering 
security issues in multiple programming languages, even “translating” between them. 
Sentiment analysis: analyze text to determine the customer’s tone in order understand customer 
feedback at scale and aid in brand reputation management.  
Language translation: provides wider coverage to organizations across languages and geographies with 
fluent translations and multilingual capabilities. 
LLMs stand to impact every industry, from finance to insurance, human resources to healthcare and 
beyond, by automating customer self-service, accelerating response times on an increasing number of 
tasks as well as providing greater accuracy, enhanced routing and intelligent context gathering.

# Challenges of LLMs 
LLMs pose a number of concerns. 
Like broader generative AI technologies, LLMs pose significant threats to certain industries, such as 
finance, journalism, and customer support. 
In education and academia, LLMs can enable individuals to cheat on assignments and papers. According 
to Nature, there have been numerous papers published in journals with the phrase “regenerate 
response” — indicating the text was copied from an LLM like ChatGPT. 
Data bias is another major challenge, as these LLMs often replicate and amplify biases from their training 
data. A study published by Apple's Machine Learning Research on four different LLMs highlighted how 
these models are prone to stereotyping professions based on gender. 
A particularly pressing legal challenge involves copyright infringement issues. LLMs typically require vast 
amounts of data for training, which they often get by scraping content from various sources, including 
copyrighted materials without explicit permission. Recently the New York Times and several other US 
newspapers sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, highlighting the complex ethical and 
legal landscape that surrounds LLMs. 
LLMs also can generate and spread misleading or false information, posing risks to information integrity 
and public trust.
